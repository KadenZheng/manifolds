    "- Points are colored by the **result day** (the answer)\n",

    "1. **Clustering Patterns**\n",
    "   - Early layers: More mixed clustering\n",
    "   - Later layers: Clearer separation by result day\n",

    "   - These are identity operations (Monday + 7 = Monday)\n",
    "   - Compare how they affect the overall structure\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variance Explained**\n",
    "   - Notice how variance changes across layers\n",
    "   - Compare between the two datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Day Groupings**\n",
    "   - See how the model learns to group operations by their answer\n",
    "   - Look for circular or structured arrangements in later layers\n"
